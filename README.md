# Insight Dashboard

On week 9 at the School of Code bootcamp, we were put into groups of four and asked to design a full stack web application which helps to address challenges that bootcampers face while learning remotely. On the Friday of that week we presented our solution to a panel of judges from the industry. We decided to create a dashboard to help bootcampers decompresses after an intense day of learning.

## Lessons Learned

We had unavoidable setbacks and then we became a team of three when we were already behind.
The big takeaway for us is how important morale and good energy is, as well as team cohesion.
It was important for us to keep moving forward and to stay agile. 

This week, we lived out the following values from The Agile Manifesto:
* Responding to change over following a plan
* Individual and interactions over processes and tools and 
* Working software over comprehensive documents 

On Thursday morning of our project week, we made a recovery plan, reviewed our MVP, prioritized accordingly, and scaled back. At the end of the week we presented to the judges a functioning app which was coded almost entirely in a day.
