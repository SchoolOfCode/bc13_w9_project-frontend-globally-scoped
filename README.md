## Lessons Learned

We had unavoidable setbacks and then we became a team of three when we were already behind.
The big takeaway for us is how important morale and good energy is, as well as team cohesion.
It was important for us to keep moving forward and to stay agile. 

This week, we lived out the following values from The Agile Manifesto:
* Responding to change over following a plan
* Individual and interactions over processes and tools and 
* Working software over comprehensive documents 

On Thursday morning, we made a recovery plan, reviewed our MVP, prioritized accordingly, and scaled back.
